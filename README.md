# Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12, [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. To start the back-end server run the comand `npm run startServer`. Make sure that the port `3000` is available.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Regarding DB

In this project I am using the cloud feature of MongoDB. In the file `app.js`, inside the folder `backend` add you own MogoDB link.

## Regarding CSS

I using Bootstap for styling. Also copied template from random website. Styling is not my own work. Credit goes to some random devs.
